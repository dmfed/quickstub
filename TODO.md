1. Think of a better way to run in Docker.
Options: 
- launch with default config showing the manual at / when no configuration file is provided.
- think of a different config structure (separate files for each enpoint and read dir contents on start applying all found configs)
- think of other reconfigure options (add/delete/change single endpoint)

2. Think of more interesting usecases than just stub for testing (e.g. serve static/js, serve files etc.). 
3. Think of Go-way configuration (everyting can be done from CLI)
